Problem://
Given an array of int, within which every element appears twice except for one, your task is to find that single one.

Example: 
INPUT: 1,1,2,2,3
OUTPUT: 3

Solution:
Notice the word 'twice'. It is easy to remember the XOR, which has the features that A XOR A = 0, A XOR 0 = A. Whenever meeting the word 'twice', it's worth to give XOR a try. In this problem, you can simply XOR all the numbers, and the result is exactly the single one you want.

Code:
{% highlight java %}
public class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] A) {
        int result = A[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < A.length; i++)
            result ^= A[i];
        return result;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}
